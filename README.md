Outline

Hello! This is the Week_1 pairing challenge project, Boris Bikes! 🚲

We've been commissioned by Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, to build the best bike system in London. 🚀

We're going to create a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. By building a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream into a reality.

The Task

Throughout the course of the project we we’re given several User Stories which are listed below. We started to determine which parts of the User Story are Objects and which are Methods. As in all TDD we created a test for a feature that we wanted to manipulate and then wrote the code to pass those tests.

Installation Instructions

Clone the repository from github then change directory into it.

$ git clone git@github.com:BenSheridanEdwards/Boris_Bikes.git
$ cd Boris_Bikes
Load dependencies with bundle.

$ gem install bundle
$ bundle
Load the app in IRB.

$ irb
2.6.3 :001 > load './lib/docking_station.rb'
 => true
 2.6.3 :002 > load './lib/bike.rb'
 => true
Feature Tests (How it works)
2.6.3 :003 > station = DockingStation.new
2.6.3 :004 > bike = Bike.new

# To report your bike as broken, use .report_broken
2.6.3 :005 > bike.report_broken
2.6.3 :006 > bike.working?
 => false

# To dock at station, use .dock on the station and pass the bike as an argument,
# you can then see bikes inside the station with .bikes
# This will fail if the docking station is full

2.6.3 :005 > station.dock(bike)
2.2.3 :008 > station.bike_dock
 => [#<Bike:0x007fdb4d9b5250 @working=true>]
