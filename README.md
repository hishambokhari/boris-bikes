Outline
Hello! This is the Week_1 pairing challenge project, Boris Bikes! ðŸš²

We've been commissioned by Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, to build the best bike system in London. ðŸš€

We're going to create a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. By building a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream into a reality.

The Task
Throughout the course of the project we weâ€™re given several User Stories which are listed below. We started to determine which parts of the User Story are Objects and which are Methods. As in all TDD we created a test for a feature that we wanted to manipulate and then wrote the code to pass those tests.

Installation Instructions
Clone the repository from github then change directory into it.

$ git clone git@github.com:BenSheridanEdwards/Boris_Bikes.git
$ cd Boris_Bikes
Load dependencies with bundle.

$ gem install bundle
$ bundle
Load the app in IRB.

$ irb
2.6.3 :001 > load './lib/docking_station.rb'
 => true
 2.6.3 :002 > load './lib/bike.rb'
 => true
Feature Tests (How it works)
2.6.3 :003 > station = DockingStation.new
2.6.3 :004 > bike = Bike.new

# To report your bike as broken, use .report_broken
2.6.3 :005 > bike.report_broken
2.6.3 :006 > bike.working?
 => false

# To dock at station, use .dock on the station and pass the bike as an argument,
# you can then see bikes inside the station with .bikes
# This will fail if the docking station is full

2.6.3 :005 > station.dock(bike)
2.2.3 :008 > station.bike_dock
 => [#<Bike:0x007fdb4d9b5250 @working=true>]


User Stories:

So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can control the distribution of bikes,
I'd like docking stations not to accept more bikes than their capacity.

As a system maintainer,
So that I can plan the distribution of bikes,
I want a docking station to have a default capacity of 20 bikes.

As a system maintainer,
So that busy areas can be served more effectively,
I want to be able to specify a larger capacity when necessary.

As a member of the public,
So that I reduce the chance of getting a broken bike in future,
I'd like to report a bike as broken when I return it.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations not to release broken bikes.

As a maintainer of the system,
So that I can manage broken bikes and not disappoint users,
I'd like docking stations to accept returning bikes (broken or not).
